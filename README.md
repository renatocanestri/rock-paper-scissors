The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors.

This project was proposed by The Odin Project. I developed a game called Rock Paper Scissors, initially using JavaScript to build the game logic through functions. Subsequently, I refactored the code to include a user interface, employing Event Listeners to enable game-play. This process allowed me to reinforce my proficiency in HTML and CSS, while also honing my problem-solving skills.
