The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors.

This project is part of The Odin Project curriculum. I created a game called Rock Paper Scissors, initially implementing the game logic using JavaScript functions. Later, i refactored the code to incorporate a user interface, utilizing Event Listeners to enable game-play interactions. This experience helped me strengthen my HTML and CSS skills, while also enhancing my problem-solving abilities and practicing my JavaScript programming skills.
